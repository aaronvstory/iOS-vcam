    "severity": "medium",
    "title": "Accessibility: Potential Low Contrast for Highlighted Menu Item",
    "details": "The 'USB STREAMING' menu option uses '-ForegroundColor Black -BackgroundColor Yellow'. While intended for highlighting, this combination may result in low contrast for users with certain visual impairments or in console environments with non-standard color palettes, making it difficult to read.",
    "file": "iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1",
    "line": 673,
    "recommendation": "Consider using a color combination with higher contrast for better readability. Tools like WebAIM Contrast Checker (though for web, principles apply) can help identify suitable combinations. Alternatively, use a different highlighting mechanism if color contrast cannot be guaranteed across all console environments."
  },
  {
    "severity": "low",
    "title": "Accessibility: Potential Low Contrast for Informational Text",
    "details": "The informational bullet points beneath the 'USB STREAMING' option use '-ForegroundColor Gray' and '-ForegroundColor DarkGray'. Depending on the console's default background, these colors might have insufficient contrast, impairing readability for some users.",
    "file": "iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1",
    "line": 676,
    "recommendation": "Use a more distinct foreground color for important informational text, or ensure that the chosen gray shades provide adequate contrast against typical console backgrounds. White or a brighter color is generally safer for primary text."

    "severity": "note",
    "title": "Best Practice: Hardcoded Console Colors",
    "details": "While common in PowerShell console scripts, hardcoding specific foreground and background colors (`-ForegroundColor`, `-BackgroundColor`) can make it challenging to adapt to user-preferred console themes or to ensure consistent branding/accessibility across different environments. The 'ASCII art' borders also contribute to this.",
    "file": "iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1",
    "line": 671,
    "recommendation": "For simple scripts, this is acceptable. For more complex or user-facing applications, consider using PowerShell's default colors or a color scheme module, or providing options for users to customize colors if extensive UI customization is a goal."
  },
  {
    "severity": "low",
    "title": "Readability: Update Read-Host Prompt Order",
    "details": "The `Read-Host` prompt was updated to reflect the new order, which is good. However, explicitly listing all options in the prompt `[U, A, B, 1, 3-9, C, Q]` can become cumbersome if more options are added or removed frequently. While this is done to guide the user, it is prone to being outdated.",
    "file": "iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1",
    "line": 3968,
    "recommendation": "Maintain consistency as done here. For very dynamic menus, consider generating the prompt dynamically based on available options, or simply use a more generic prompt like 'Enter your choice:' if the menu itself is clear."

The changes primarily focus on improving user guidance and highlighting a recommended option in the console menu. The main areas for improvement are related to accessibility, specifically ensuring sufficient color contrast for the highlighted 'USB STREAMING' option and the informational bullet points. Adhering to best practices for hardcoded colors is also a minor consideration for future maintainability. Performance and security are not negatively impacted by these changes.
