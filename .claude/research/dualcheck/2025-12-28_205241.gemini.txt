The PowerShell cleanup diff appears to be clean and well-executed. All removed functions and their associated menu options and call sites have been successfully eliminated from the script, leading to no orphaned references or immediate logical issues.
I've reviewed the provided PowerShell diff and confirmed that the removed functions (`Show-EnhancedDebBuilder`, `Start-USBForwarderMode`, `Start-USBHotspotMode`) and their corresponding menu entries and `switch` statement cases have been cleanly removed. No orphaned references or logic issues were found. The changes appear to be thorough and correct.
