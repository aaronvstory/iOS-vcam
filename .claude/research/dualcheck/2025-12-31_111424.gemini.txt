### Summary
The changes introduce excellent **2025 best practices** for multi-device support, specifically the use of the `-u <UDID>` flag for `iproxy` and the port-based process targeting to prevent conflicts with VNC software. However, there are **critical security and logic issues**: hardcoding a PID in `shutdown.bat` makes the script unusable outside of a single specific run, and hardcoded credentials ('icemat') pose a major security risk. Additionally, security is unnecessarily weakened by the `-no-antispoof` flag. The project should transition to SSH keys and name-based process management to reach a production-ready state.
