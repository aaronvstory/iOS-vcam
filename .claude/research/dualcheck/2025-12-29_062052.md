### Issues (deduped)

- **[MEDIUM]** Inadequate Color Contrast for Menu Items (iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1:700) — _sources: gemini_
  - The `Show-MainMenu` function uses hardcoded foreground colors like `Magenta`, `Gray`, and `DarkGray`. These colors may not meet WCAG contrast guidelines on dark terminal backgrounds.
  - **Recommendation:** Pre-existing issue, not introduced by this change. Consider future enhancement to ensure colors meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements.

- **[LOW]** Inconsistent Input Prompt Format (iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1:3960) — _sources: gemini_
  - The prompt mixes single character options (`A, B, U, C, Q`) with a numerical range (`3-9`).
  - **Recommendation:** Pre-existing style choice. Could be standardized in future but not blocking for this change.

### Cross-Referenced Issues (Both AIs Flagged)

None - Codex found no issues with the changes.

---

### Verdict

**APPROVED FOR MERGE** - Both AIs confirm the changes are minimal risk:
- Codex explicitly states: "No issues found... only reorder the USB streaming menu entry and adjust the prompt text ordering, with no impact on logic, error handling, or resource behavior."
- Gemini's findings are pre-existing accessibility considerations, not introduced by this change.

  {
    "severity": "MEDIUM",
    "title": "Inadequate Color Contrast for Menu Items",
    "details": "The `Show-MainMenu` function uses hardcoded foreground colors like `Magenta`, `Gray`, and `DarkGray`. These colors, particularly `Gray` and `DarkGray` on a typical dark terminal background, may not meet WCAG contrast guidelines, making the text difficult to read for users with low vision or certain forms of color blindness.",
    "file": "iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1",
    "line": 700,
    "recommendation": "Avoid hardcoding colors where possible. If colors are used for emphasis, ensure they meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements against expected terminal background colors."

    "title": "Inconsistent Input Prompt Format",
    "details": "The `Read-Host` prompt for user choice mixes single character options (`A, B, U, C, Q`) with a numerical range (`3-9`). While understandable, explicitly listing all options or standardizing the format could improve clarity.",
    "file": "iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1",
    "line": 3960,
    "recommendation": "Standardize the format for listing available options in the `Read-Host` prompt."
  }
]
```

The changes are primarily cosmetic, reordering the "USB STREAMING (SSH Tunnel)" menu option. No new security, performance, or platform compatibility issues introduced.

### Raw Codex Output
