  "details": "The command `plink -R 1935:localhost:1935` typically binds the listener to `127.0.0.1` on the remote device (iPhone). However, the documentation and code comments state the iPhone app is patched to connect to `127.10.10.10`. Unless the iPhone OS routes `127.10.10.10` to `127.0.0.1` automatically (which is not guaranteed on all systems), the connection may fail.",

### Summary

The changes introduce a robust "USB Streaming" feature using standard tools (`iproxy`, `plink`). The implementation follows the existing project structure and style well.

**Key Findings:**
*   **Networking Logic**: The main technical risk is the mismatch between the `plink` default bind address (`127.0.0.1`) and the target IP mentioned in the docs (`127.10.10.10`). This needs verification on the actual device.
*   **User Experience**: The script wisely uses separate windows for the tunnel components, allowing users to see logs and interactive prompts (like SSH key acceptance).
*   **Dependencies**: The checks for `iproxy` and `idevice_id` are good, though slightly rigid with the `C:\iProxy` path.

The code is generally safe and idiomatic for a PowerShell launcher script.
