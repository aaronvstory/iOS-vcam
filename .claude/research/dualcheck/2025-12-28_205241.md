### Gemini Findings (Best Practices & Security)

Gemini reviewed the diff and found:
- **Clean Removal**: All three functions (`Show-EnhancedDebBuilder`, `Start-USBForwarderMode`, `Start-USBHotspotMode`) and their corresponding menu entries and switch cases were completely removed.
- **No Orphaned References**: No remaining calls to the deleted functions.
- **No Logic Issues**: The cleanup appears thorough with no architectural problems.

**Verdict:** No action required.

### Codex Findings (Logic & Architecture)

Codex performed deep analysis and found:
- **No References Remaining**: Searched the entire codebase for function names and menu text - no matches.
- **Menu Logic Consistent**: The main menu switch statement and prompt text are correctly updated to `[A, B, 1, 3-9, C, Q]`.

### Raw Gemini Output

```
```json
[
  {
    "severity": "info",
    "title": "Clean Removal of Functions and Menu Options",
    "details": "The functions `Show-EnhancedDebBuilder`, `Start-USBForwarderMode`, and `Start-USBHotspotMode` along with their corresponding menu entries and `switch` statement cases have been completely removed. No orphaned references or direct logical issues were found in the `iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1` script after their removal.",
    "file": "iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1",
    "line": "N/A",
    "recommendation": "No further action required based on this review. The cleanup appears to be thorough."
  }
]
```
The PowerShell cleanup diff appears to be clean and well-executed. All removed functions and their associated menu options and call sites have been successfully eliminated from the script, leading to no orphaned references or immediate logical issues.
```

### Raw Codex Output

```
```json
[]
```

No git diff was present in the repo, but the current `iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1` shows no remaining references or menu entries for those removed functions, and the main menu/switch logic stays consistent with the updated option list.
```
