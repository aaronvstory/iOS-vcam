    "details": "The replacement of `atoi()` with `strtol()` for PID parsing in `jetsamctl.c`, coupled with comprehensive error checking for `errno`, `endptr`, and positive value, dramatically improves the safety and reliability of PID validation.

    "file": "iOS-VCAM-Launcher.ps1",
    "line": "2293",
    "recommendation": "Consider adding logic to the PowerShell script to parse `$jetsamResult` and present a concise summary of the `VNC_OK` and `SSHD_OK` statuses to the user, rather than dumping the full remote command output. This would improve user feedback."
  }

```

The review of the PowerShell code fixes indicates that all identified issues have been correctly addressed. The `strtol()` implementation for PID validation is a particularly strong improvement in terms of safety and robustness. A minor recommendation is to enhance the PowerShell script's output parsing for better user feedback on the success of jetsam protection.
