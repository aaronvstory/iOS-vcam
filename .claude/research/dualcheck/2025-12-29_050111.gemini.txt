    "severity": "MEDIUM",
    "title": "RealVNC Viewer Spawning Multiple Windows Per Invocation",
    "details": "The batch script's `both_usb` section explicitly calls the `:connect_vnc` subroutine twice, once for `localhost:5901` and once for `localhost:5902`. Each call to `:connect_vnc` uses the `start` command to launch `vncviewer.exe`. Based on the problem description, this results in four VNC viewer windows being opened (two for each intended connection). This behavior indicates that each instance of `vncviewer.exe`, when launched via the `start` command with a direct target, is inadvertently opening two windows rather than one. A common cause for such a precise doubling is that the VNC viewer might be configured or designed to open an additional auxiliary window (e.g., a connection manager, a blank viewer, or a 'new connection' dialog) alongside the direct connection window, even when a specific connection target is provided.",
    "file": "iOS-VCAM-Launcher.bat",
    "line": "197-198 (calls to :connect_vnc) and 147-151 (start command within :connect_vnc)",
    "recommendation": "Investigate RealVNC Viewer's command-line arguments and configuration settings. Look for options that can suppress additional GUI elements or connection managers when launching a direct connection. For instance, some VNC clients offer 'silent' modes or flags (e.g., `--no-gui`, `--single-window`, or similar) to ensure only the requested connection window appears. Consult the RealVNC Viewer documentation for available command-line switches."

```

The root cause of the issue is likely **RealVNC Viewer's internal behavior** when invoked, where each launch of `vncviewer.exe` creates *two* separate windows (e.g., the intended connection window plus an auxiliary window like a connection manager or blank viewer) instead of just one. The batch script correctly calls the VNC launch command twice, so the doubling effect must originate from how the `vncviewer.exe` application responds to being started.
