## Gemini Review

### Issues Found

| Severity | Issue | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| CRITICAL | `root @localhost` space in plink command | FALSE POSITIVE - actual code has `root@localhost` |
| HIGH | Port 80 false positive with System/IIS | FIXED - now checks process name is python |
| MEDIUM | Path injection in `Set-Location` | LOW RISK - project path has no special chars |
| MEDIUM | root vs mobile SSH user | INFORMATIONAL - documented behavior |
| LOW | GatewayPorts SSH config assumption | EXPECTED - 127.10.10.10 alias handles this |

### Fix Applied

Added verification that port 80 is held by Python, not System/IIS (PID 4):
```powershell
if ($port80Proc -and $port80Proc.ProcessName -match 'python|flask') {
    Write-Host "  ✅ Flask listening on port 80" -ForegroundColor Green
} elseif ($flaskCheck.OwningProcess -eq 4) {
    Write-Host "  ❌ Port 80 held by System/IIS (PID 4)!" -ForegroundColor Red
    Write-Host "     Stop IIS: Stop-Service W3SVC -Force" -ForegroundColor Gray
    $allReady = $false
}
```
